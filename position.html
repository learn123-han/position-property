        A poor farmer once bought a well from a rich man so that he could irrigate his land using the water from the well. The farmer paid the price quoted by the rich man. The next day, when the farmer when to draw water from the well, the rich man stopped him and disallowed him from drawing water. He said that the farmer had bought only the well and not the water from him. So, he cannot draw any water from the well.
Not knowing what to do, the farmer went to the kings court and told Akbar about his predisposition. Akbar handed over the case to Birbal.One day, a rich merchant went to Birbal and complained to him that his house was robbed. He also told him that he suspects one of his servants to have robbed the house. Birbal went to the merchant’s house, rounded up all the servants and asked them who robbed the house. As expected, the robber did not come forward to confess his crime.

        Birbal visited the rich man who was causing problems to the farmer. The rich man reiterated what he told the farmer, to which Birbal said, “Since you have sold the well and not the water to the farmer, you will have to move all the water or pay rent to the farmer to keep the water in the well.”

The rich man realised his ploy was not going to work and let the farmer use the well from the water.Birbal then handed a stick to each servant and told them that the robber’s stick will grow 2 inches longer the next morning. That way, they will be able to identify who robbed the merchant. The next morning, Birbal asked the servants for the sticks and pointed out the culprit to the merchant. The robber had reduced the length of the stick by 2 inches anticipating the stick to grow by the next morning. That’s how Birbal figured who the robber was.
